# Soccer_Games_Prediction
Predicting Outcome of Soccer matches

1. Download sqlite dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/downloads/database.sqlite/10) and put it in a folder named soccer.
2. Run SoccerPrediction.ipynb to generate Matches_EPL.csv (since it is greater than 25MB which is the limit of github!) and Matches_EPL_Processed.csv.
3. Run Soccer_Modelling.ipynb to generate and save the best model for prediction
4. Run main_frontend.ipynb and open the localhost link to the frontend to select teams and make predictions!
